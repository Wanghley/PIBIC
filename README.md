Project of Scientific Research in the field of biomedice engineering with the aim of build a ende-to-end system of collection,analysis and visualization of biomedical data related to neuromotors diseases as Parkinson Disease (PD) - the main studied disease in this project.

## Getting Started

In order to use or develop this project you must install mainly ```pybluez``` and ``pyqt5``, since they are the core used in the process of this project at all.

### Prerequisites

You need to install these things to run the project

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
pip3 install pybluez
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Built With

* [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) - Cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt
